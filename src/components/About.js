          Hello! my name is Daniel and I have a passion for creating immersive websites. I am a self-taught front-end developer with experience in multiple programming languages and frameworks. Throughout my career, I have worked as an independent developer, leveraging my self-starting mentality to deliver exceptional results. My interest in web development was sparked in 2018 when I began building small websites for local friends and musicians, and I have been hooked ever since.
